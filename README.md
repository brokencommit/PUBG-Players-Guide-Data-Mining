# PlayerKowns Battlegrounds

## Description: 
A complex problem that players run into
before every game is where to eject from the
plane and which site to land. Our focus in this
project will be to optimize player choices within
the early, middle, and late game. Early game
decisions such as areas to drop will greatly
increase a player’s ability to survive towards mid
game. By analyzing the areas where players die
the most, we can see areas to avoid, allowing
players a higher probability of making it past the
40 players left mark. We will look at distance
traveled to see if travelling more often will give a
player a higher chance of surviving. This can
affect player behavior during the middle and end
of the game. If travelling decreases a players
chance of surviving, we can draw the conclusion
that “camping” can be an efficient method to win
the game. We can also do analysis of weapons
to help players choose an arsenal that best fits
their needs. We will aggregate weapon and
death data to determine which weapons are
most efficient at long range. We can also see
which weapons have the most kills at the end of
the game, so that players can determine what
weapon they should have to win the battle
royale.

## Summary of Questions:
What areas should be avoided and oppositely, what areas should be visited?
What weapons are used most, and what weapons are good for certain scenarios?
Which map has more clusters?
Overall, what are the best practices in PUBG in order to survive the longest?

## Answers:
The areas to avoid include Pochinki, Military Base, and School. Areas that should be visited include those indicated in the k-means graph. Depending on the playstyle of the player, players might want to drop in less populated areas.
The weapons used most include ARs, especially M4A1 and SCAR. Weapons that should be used early game include sniper rifles for long ranges.
Overall, the best practices in PUBG would be to drop in less populated areas and to use the M4A1, which racks up the most kills. More in depth answer can be found in our notebook.

## Application:
A guide of areas to avoid.
Weapons to use based on kills. We found certain weapons had higher average kills and longer distance kills.
Weapons to use based on final circle and distance. Weapons such as the sniper rifle should not be used during the final circle since the distance isn't required.
Popularity of weapons based on the map you’re randomly given
Areas to drop given smaller clusters
